I am a bioinformaticist and geneticist in the research group of [Dr. Bruce Budowle] (https://www.unthsc.edu/graduate-school-of-biomedical-sciences/molecular-and-medical-genetics/laboratory-faculty-and-staff/) at UNTHSC. My educational background is both in [population genetics] (https://uacc.arizona.edu/profile/michael-hammer) and in [computation] (https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~kece/) and my research interests broadly fall into the areas of forensic genetics and population genomics. 

### Current Research

I have several ongoing research projects.
