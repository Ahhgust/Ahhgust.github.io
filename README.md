## Welcome to August Woerner's web page!


### About me as a scholar

I am a bioinformaticist and geneticist in the research group of [Dr. Bruce Budowle](https://www.unthsc.edu/graduate-school-of-biomedical-sciences/molecular-and-medical-genetics/laboratory-faculty-and-staff/) at UNTHSC. My educational background is both in [population genetics](https://uacc.arizona.edu/profile/michael-hammer) and in [computation](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~kece/) and my research interests broadly fall into the areas of forensic genetics and population genomics. 

### Current Research

Most problems in forensic genetics boil down to the simple problem of *whose DNA is this?*. This problem is readily addressed when there is ample (single source) template to work with it becomes more challenging when either the DNA is scarce or when the DNA is mixed. Our research addresses these issues (and additional ones) by:

1. Targetting non-human DNAs (the DNA from the microbiome)
2. Targetting DNA products (more stable protein markers)
3. Assessing whole mitochondrial genomes (higher abundance)
4. Using unique molecular identifiers (absolute quantitation)
